🍴 Restaurant Management System - Taif University

**About the Project**
This is my college project from Taif University.
I developed this system with a team of 5 students to help restaurants manage their orders and menus electronically.

✨ My Role (70% of the work)

I was responsible for the core technical parts of the project:

I developed the back-end logic using Java and PHP.

I designed the database using MySQL via XAMPP to store all restaurant data.

I connected the web pages (HTML/CSS) with the database to make the system dynamic.

🛡️ Digital Forensics Perspective
Since my passion is Digital Forensics, I built this project with a security mindset:

I learned how data moves between the website and the server, 
which is the first step in digital investigation.

I organized the database to ensure data integrity and prevent information loss.

I implemented a simple login system to control access and protect the system.

🛠️ Tools and Languages
Programming: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS.
Database: MySQL.
Software: XAMPP, Visual Studio Code, GitHub.

📂 How to check my work

You can open the .sql file to see my database design,
and check the PHP and Java files to see how I programmed the connection and logic.
